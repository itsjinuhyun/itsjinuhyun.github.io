# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns to map input features to output labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training models on data without labeled responses. The algorithm tries to find patterns or structure in the data on its own.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature**: An individual measurable property of the phenomenon being observed.
- **Label**: The output variable we're trying to predict.
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process.
- **Training**: The process of learning patterns from data.
- **Inference**: Using a trained model to make predictions.

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and extracting insights from data. As the field continues to evolve, it's becoming increasingly important in various domains, from healthcare to finance to self-driving cars.

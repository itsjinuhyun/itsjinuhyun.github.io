## Overview

Android malware evolves rapidly, producing new families long before labeled data becomes available, rendering supervised classifiers ineffective against zero-day threats. This research addresses the "small data" problem in cybersecurity by exploring Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and Meta-Learning techniques for malware recognition.

Unlike natural-image Zero-Shot Learning where semantics align closely with visual structure, malware visualization encodes behavioral and structural signals such as entropy, resulting in weak semantic alignment and extreme distribution shift. We propose a unified benchmark protocol and evaluation pipeline built on top of the MalVis dataset to compare optimization-based meta-learning methods against classical zero-shot learning approaches.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Benchmark**: Evaluated multiple meta-learning methods (MAML, MAML++, Reptile, Mi-MAML) against zero-shot learning approaches (SAE, PSR-ZSL, DAZLE) across different experimental settings
- **MalVis Dataset**: Utilized large-scale Android malware visualization dataset with 256×256 RGB visual representations encoding entropy and structural patterns
- **Episodic Evaluation**: Implemented standard N-way K-shot episodic learning framework to simulate real-world "small data" scenarios
- **Multiple Evaluation Scenarios**: Tested models under unseen-only, generalized few-shot, and benign-dominant deployment settings

## Implementation Details

The project frames malware detection as a few-shot image classification problem. Malware binaries are visualized as grayscale images where texture patterns correspond to code structures, allowing us to leverage computer vision techniques for classification.

**Episodic Learning Framework**: Each task (episode) consists of:
- **Support Set**: A small set of labeled examples used for model adaptation (e.g., 5 classes with 1-5 images each)
- **Query Set**: Unlabeled samples from the same classes used to evaluate the adapted model

**Models Evaluated**:
- **MAML**: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning using bilevel optimization
- **MAML++**: Enhanced MAML with per-step learnable learning rates
- **Reptile**: First-order approximation that moves initialization weights towards trained parameters
- **Mi-MAML**: Multi-Improved MAML with dynamic inner-loop learning rates and momentum-based meta-updates
- **SAE, PSR-ZSL, DAZLE**: Semantic-based zero-shot learning baselines

The evaluation protocol follows standard few-shot learning practices with 5-way classification in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, measuring per-class accuracy to ensure robust detection across all malware families.

## Results

**Performance on Unseen Malware Families**:
- Mi-MAML achieved the highest accuracy: **49% (1-shot)** and **55% (5-shot)**
- Outperformed all other meta-learning and zero-shot learning baselines

**Generalized Few-Shot Classification**:
- Mi-MAML achieved the highest harmonic mean: **0.61 (1-shot)** and **0.68 (5-shot)**
- Demonstrated superior balance between recognizing known threats and novel malware families

**Benign-Dominant Deployment Scenario**:
- Mi-MAML maintained **85% benign accuracy (1-shot)** and **93% (5-shot)** while achieving **52% unseen malware detection (1-shot)** and **62% (5-shot)**
- Consistently outperformed baselines in real-world deployment settings with class imbalance

**Key Findings**:
- Task-adaptive meta-learning (especially Mi-MAML) is more appropriate than semantic-based zero-shot learning for malware recognition in low-data settings
- Malware visualizations have weak semantic alignment, making traditional ZSL methods less effective
- Mi-MAML's stable meta-optimization handles variability and distribution shifts caused by malware obfuscation effectively

The study establishes MalVis-based episodic evaluation as a rigorous test for studying rapid generalization under severe obfuscation and abrupt class shifts in cybersecurity applications.

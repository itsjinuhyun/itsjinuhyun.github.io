Hi, I am currently a first-year data science masters student at NYU Center for Data Science. Previously, I studied math at UT Austin.

I'm interested in all things data, machine learning, and mixed martial arts. I've created a space for me to jot down notes on things I find interesting and share what I am working on.

[Blog](/blog) for fun.

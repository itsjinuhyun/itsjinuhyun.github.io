I'm Jinu Hyun, a M.S. Data Science student at New York University. Previously, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from UT Austin.

I'm interested in all things data, machine learning, and mixed martial arts. I've created a space for me to jot down notes on things I find interesting and share what I am working on.
